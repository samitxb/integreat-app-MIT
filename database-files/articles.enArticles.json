Different bins are provided for plastic, paper and cardboard, organic waste (fruit and vegetable leftovers), and other types of waste. Please adhere to waste separation, as a large portion of the waste is recycled, which is an important aspect of environmental protection. You can find information about disposal <u><a href=\"https://www.passau.de/bauen-umwelt/umwelt-klimaschutz/abfall-recycling/\">here</a></u>.</li>\n  <li><strong>Wastewater disposal:</strong> Food leftovers or items should not be disposed of in the toilet, as they provide a food source for rats. The organic waste bin is available for disposing of food remnants. The toilet is not a trash can. Therefore, do not dispose of hygiene items (pads, wet wipes) in the toilet, but use the garbage bin instead.</li>\n  <li><strong>Ventilation:</strong> It's advisable to regularly open the windows to let in fresh air.

However, only if you are in need of assistance.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Important:</strong> When you have found an apartment, do not immediately sign the lease.

It is significantly higher than the basic rent (Kaltmiete).</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Deposit, Initial Equipment, Replacement, and Registration</strong></p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The deposit serves as security for the landlord. The amount for the deposit is a maximum of 3 basic rents.

Therefore, you will need new furniture. You can apply for initial equipment at the job center. The job center will then provide you with a lump sum, which may vary depending on the number of people and the size of the apartment. If your previous tenant leaves various items in the apartment, you can buy these from them (replacement).</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Caution:</strong> It may take several weeks for the money to be paid out by the job center!</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Please remember to register your new address (in person) with the residents' registration office.</p>\n",
